# meeting
a free and secure peer to peer meeting application

-> This application uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer streamings

-> The initial signaling is done through a WebScoket channel (thanks to [www.openode.io](https://www.openode.io/)). The data transferred in this channel is encrypted with the given password by the peer.
