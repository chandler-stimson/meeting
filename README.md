# meeting
a free and secure peer to peer [meeting](https://add0n.com/meeting.html) application

-> This application uses WebRTC for peer-to-peer streamings

-> The initial signaling is done through a WebScoket channel (thanks to [replit.com](https://replit.com/@meetingserver)). The data transferred in this channel is encrypted with the given password by the peer.
